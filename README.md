# supereuler
A polynomial time algorithm for determine Supereulerian graphs

The program reads data from the data.txt file. It needs to put the input file in the exe file and the directory.The format of the sample in the input file is: the first line is the number of vertices, and the second line begins with an adjacency matrix, each element of which is separated by a space character.(I have written programs that generate data.txt files specifically, which can query the "SuperEulerDataSet.")

Program output for out. TXT file, it saves graph which is judged to be non-supereulerian graph.The format of the output file is: the first line is the number, so as to facilitate the corresponding in the input file.Line 2 begins with an adjacency matrix, each element of which is separated by a space character.
